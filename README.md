# A Breakable Toy Experiment – Command-Line Accounting 

## About <a name = "about"></a>
The goal of this project is to create a simple implementation of the [ledged-cli](https://ledger-cli.org/)

Ledger is a powerful, double-entry accounting system that is accessed from the UNIX command-line. Ledger, begun in 2003, is written by John Wiegley and released under the BSD license. It has also inspired several ports to other languages.

Ledger is a command-line accounting tool that provides double-entry accounting based on a text journal. It provides no bells or whistles, and returns the user to the days before user interfaces were even a twinkling in their fathers’ CRTs.
